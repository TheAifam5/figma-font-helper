# Rusty Figma Font Helper

A basic Figma Font Helper. It was made around 4 years ago so a lot of stuff is outdated. I might work on a new version, much simpler and more efficient. :)
Don't expect much from this project.

## Usage

If you are using Linux, change your browser's user agent to a macOS or Windows user agent.

## TODO

- Restrict /figma/font-file
- In-Memory Font Database
- Windows support
- macOS support
